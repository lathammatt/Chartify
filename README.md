# Chartify

*workspace/capstonenodeversion*

I am a music addict and a data junkie as well. I always enjoyed creating my own "Billboard" charts based on my album collection (used notebook paper when I was younger). This capstone project for Nashville Software School accesses Spotify's API for basic album info. It then allows a user to rate songs and sorts the albums based on those ratings into a personal chart of favorite albums. I used Materialize, AngularJS, Firebase, jQuery, and some Node.Js for optional Spotify features.
